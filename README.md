Christian.ics
=============
A calendar of major Christian holidays in the Gregorian calendar,
written with the intent of not ever needing to be updated.  It uses
recurrence rules that should be valid between 1900 to 2099.
The concept is that they are holidays recognized in all Christian
traditions, though this probably only applies to Western Christians.

The Easter recurrence rules are based on the dates found in
[the Wikipedia article describing the computation of the date of Easter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus).
